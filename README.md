<!-- ## Approach

I found this project quite difficult to get started on but once I broke it down into smaller chunks It became a lot easier to manage. Here's how I did it.

1. Firstly I whipped up a very basic html doc to lay out the content of the page. This included 9 divs that would later end up being the tic tac toe board.

2. Next I applied some basic CSS styling to so I would have a visual representation of what I was doing. Initially I didn't spend too much time on this as I wanted to focus on functionality.

3. Next was to get started on the game logic. This definitely took up most of the time on the project as I had to wrap my head around it. A lot of trial and error! My priority was to get the required functionality down before adding any additional features.

4. Even once the game was functioning fairly well, my next job was to test out all the possible events and check for bugs - and boy were there some bugs! It was very satisfying resolving a bug, and not so satisfying breaking everything in the process.

5. The next part was to revisit the styling. I used CSS to change the colours, fonts and layout. I added a footer and I made sure each element lined up where it should.

6. Then I went further and added in a bunch of smaller details which I very much enjoyed and feel as though they add a layer to the aesthetic. These include the shake animation, the fade in's and the flashing message when there's a winner.

7. Lastly I sent the link out to a bunch of people I know to get an external opinions. I made a few changes after this.

8. Now that I had completed the basic requirements, it was time to look into some bonus features. These are still a work in progress!

## Problems

There were definitely some challenges throughout this project. I found it difficult to get 'pen to paper' initially. Once I started to get my head around the game logic, it all started to flow.

I faced a few problems with my CSS and how to position things where I wanted. I did some extra reading on this and identify it as something I'd like to improve on! -->

## Next Steps

Add the following:

1. Support networked multiplayer.
2. Custom board sizes.
3. Sound effects/music.
4. Improve User Experience.

<!-- Aside from new features, I'd like to also take a closer look at the code I've written and refactor it. I think it can be simplified to make it easier to add features.  

A few of the comments I had in testing were to do with usability. I think there could be some improvements there too! -->
